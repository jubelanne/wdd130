             <h2>Temple Open Houses and Dedications</h2>
                <p>Visitors of all ages are invited to a free public open house held for most new or renovated temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The open house includes a video (see left) and a walk-through tour of the temple. After the temple is formally dedicated, entrance is reserved for faithful members of the Church.
